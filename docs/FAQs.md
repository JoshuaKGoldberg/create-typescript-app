# FAQs

## Do you have a guide to working with a `create-typescript-app` repository?

Yes!
See [Contributing to a create-typescript-app Repository](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/contributing-to-a-create-typescript-app-repository).
It'll walk you through the common activities you'll need to contribute to a repository scaffolded with `create-typescript-app`.

## Can I use _(insert tool here)_ with this template?

Yes!
After you set up a repository, you can substitute in any tools you'd like.

If you think the tool would be broadly useful to most consumers of this template, feel free to [file a feature request](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature&projects=&template=03-feature.yml&title=%F0%9F%9A%80+Feature%3A+%3Cshort+description+of+the+feature%3E) to add it in.

## Can I create a GitHub action?

Yes! If you want to read the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions) in detail.
Here we'll outline the steps required to migrate a CTA app to a GitHub Action:

1. GitHub Actions store built output on a GitHub branch rather than in a published package on npm.
   As a consequence we should:

   - delete `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `.github/workflows/post-release.yml`.
   - update `.github/workflows/build.yml` to ensure `dist` is up to date:

     <details>
         <summary><code>.github/workflows/build.yml</code></summary>

     ```yml
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           - uses: ./.github/actions/prepare
           - run: pnpm build

           - name: Compare dist/index.js
             run: |
               if [ "$(git diff --ignore-space-at-eol --text dist/index.js | wc -l)" -gt "0" ]; then
                 echo "Detected uncommitted changes after build."
                 echo "You may need to run 'pnpm run build' locally and commit the changes."
                 echo ""
                 echo "See diff below:"
                 echo ""
                 git diff --ignore-space-at-eol --text dist/index.js
                 echo ""
                 # say this again in case the diff is long
                 echo "You may need to run 'pnpm run build' locally and commit the changes."
                 echo ""
                 exit 1
               fi

     name: Build

     on:
       pull_request: ~
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     permissions:
       contents: read
     ```

      </details>

   - GitHub Actions run without installing package dependencies.
     Replace `tsup` with [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to build source files and dependencies into a single JS file.
     Delete `tsup.config.ts` then execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   pnpm remove tsup
   pnpm add @vercel/ncc -D
   ```

   - Now we need to update the `build` script in our `package.json`:

   ```diff
   -"build": "tsup",
   +"build": "ncc build src/index.ts -o dist --license licenses.txt",
   ```

   - Our build now emits to the `dist` directory; so we'll want to avoid linting that directory by adding the following to `.eslintignore` and our `.prettierignore`:

   ```diff
   +dist
   ```

   - Rather than having to remember to compile each time, we'll update our precommit hook in `.husky/precommit` to build for us on each commit:

   ```diff
   +pnpm run build
   +git add dist
   npx lint-staged
   ```

2. Create an [`action.yml` metadata file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action#creating-an-action-metadata-file).

It's worth reading the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action#writing-the-action-code).

## How can I add dual CommonJS / ECMAScript Modules emit?

First, I'd suggest reading [TypeScript Handbook > Modules - Introduction](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/introduction.html) to understand how CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript (ESM) came to be.

Then:

1. In `tsup.config.ts`, change the [tsup `format` option](https://tsup.egoist.dev/#bundle-formats) from `["esm"]` to `["cjs", "esm"]`
2. Add a [`package.json` `"exports"` entry](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) like:

   <!-- eslint-disable jsonc/sort-keys -->

   ```json package.json
   {
   	"exports": {
   		".": {
   			"types": {
   				"import": "./lib/index.d.ts",
   				"require": "./lib/index.d.cts"
   			},
   			"import": "./lib/index.js",
   			"require": "./lib/index.cjs"
   		}
   	}
   }
   ```

   <!-- eslint-enable jsonc/sort-keys -->

That should be it!

To be safe, consider checking with [arethetypeswrong](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io):

1. Run `pnpm build`
2. Run `npm pack`
3. Upload that generated `.tgz` file to [arethetypeswrong.github.io](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io)

### Why doesn't `create-typescript-app` have an option to dual emit CJS and ESM?

Dual CJS/ESM emit is a stopgap solution while the JavaScript ecosystem migrates towards full ESM support in most-to-all popular user packages.
Most packages newly created with `create-typescript-app` should target just ESM by default.

Some packages published with `create-typescript` legitimately need dual CJS/ESM output because they're used by frameworks that don't yet fully support ESM.
That's reasonable.

Unless you know a package needs to support a CJS consumer, please strongly consider keeping it ESM-only (the `create-typescript-app` default).
ESM-only packages have a smaller footprint by virtue of including fewer files.

## Is there a way to pull in template updates to previously created repositories?

Not directly.
You can always copy & paste them in manually, and/or re-run `npx create-typescript-app --mode migrate`.

See [ðŸš€ Feature: Add a script to sync the tooling updates from forked template repo #498](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/498): it will likely eventually be possible.

## What about `eslint-config-prettier`?

[`eslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) is an ESLint plugin that serves only to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with formatters such as Prettier.
None of the ESLint configs enabled by this repository's tooling leave any rules enabled that would need to be disabled.
Using `eslint-config-prettier` would be redundant.

## What determines which "base" a tool goes into?

The four bases correspond to what have seemed to be the most common user needs of template consumers:

1. **Minimal**: Developers who just want the barest of starting templates.
   - They may be very new to TypeScript tooling, or they may have made an informed decision that the additional tooling isn't worth the complexity and/or time investment.
   - Tooling in this base is only what would be essential for a small TypeScript package that can be built, formatted, linted, and released.
2. **Common**: The common case of users who want the minimal tooling along with common repository management.
   - Tooling added in this base should be essential for a TypeScript repository that additionally automates useful GitHub tasks: contributor recognition, release management, and testing.
3. **Everything**: Power users (including this repository) who want as much of the latest and greatest safety checks and standardization as possible.

Note that users can always customize exactly with portions are kept in with `--base` **`prompt`**.

## Which tools can't I remove?

The following pieces of this template's tooling don't have options to be removed:

- Linting with ESLint and `pnpm run lint`
- GitHub repository metadata such as the code of conduct and issue templates
- Prettier and `pnpm run format`
- tsup and `pnpm run build`
- TypeScript and `pnpm run tsc`

If you have a strong desire to add an `--exclude-*` flag for any of them, please do [file a feature request](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature&projects=&template=03-feature.yml&title=%F0%9F%9A%80+Feature%3A+%3Cshort+description+of+the+feature%3E).

## Why does this package include so many tools?

This repository is meant to serve as a starter that includes all the general tooling a modern TypeScript/Node repository could possibly need.
Each of the included tools exists for a good reason and provides real value.

If you don't want to use any particular tool, you can always remove it manually.

### What tooling does this package use that isn't part of created repositories?

Glad you asked!
These are the projects used across many parts of `create-typescript-app`:

- [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk): Makes it easier to print colored characters in the terminal.
- [Clack](https://www.clack.cc): Provides interactive terminal prompts and loading spinners.
- [execa](https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa): Makes it easier to run child processes.
- [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js#octokitjs):
- [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx): Quickly runs TypeScript files with ESBuild.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev): TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

## Why tabs?

This repository template configures `"useTabs": true` in the root-level `.prettierrc.json`.
It does so because tabs have been phrased by the community as generally better for accessibility:

- <https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/3098>
- <https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/7475>

Note that those points on tabs over spaces have generally been made by accessibility-experienced _individuals_ rather than accessibility-focused _organizations_.
If you know of any accessibility organization that's published more formal recommendations or research, please do file an issue here for this FAQ entry to be updated.

You can adjust the tab size that GitHub uses to display files from your [account settings page](https://github.com/settings/appearance#tab-size-heading) (the default is 8 spaces).

If you really want spaces in your project you can always remove the `"useTabs": true`.
